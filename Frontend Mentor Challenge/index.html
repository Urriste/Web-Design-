  						did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  						project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  						could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  						experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  						100% recommend! ”
